Description
==========================
This module provides an interface to the LTS UW People plugin.  Using the UW
Groups LTS plugin, the module fetches a "master list" of NetIDs based on a list
of groups and then pulls the majority of information from the UW PWS into Drupal
using content types as storage.

The content types defined by this module have extra fields to help aid
building a student/faculty/staff directory.

NOTE: It is best not to modify the built in content types defined by this
module - any changes you make will likely be over-written in an update.
Currently extensions to the data outside of those built-in are not supported.

Created by the University of Washington Information School; see LICENSE file.


Install
==========================
Move folder to DRUPAL_ROOT/sites/all/modules and rename to "uwpeople".  Enable
the module in Drupal.  NOTE: LTS, the UW Groups LTS plugin, and the UW People
LTS plugin will have to be setup before this module will work.

If you want to refresh the data on a set schedule the module includes its own
cron script "uwpeople_cron.php" that should be scheduled separately from Drupal's
main cron script.


Recovering from Errors
==========================
If an error occurs during an AJAX update (i.e. through the settings page) and
you get repeated "Another user is currently refreshing people data." errors,
the following must be done to "reset" the module:

  1) Restart Apache [non-graceful] (or whatever web server you are using)
  2) Delete the variable from the {variable} table with name "uwpeople_ajax_token"
