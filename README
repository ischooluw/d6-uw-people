Description
==========================
This module provides an interface to the LTS UW People plugin.  Using the UW
Groups LTS plugin, the module fetches a "master list" of NetIDs based on a list
of groups and then pulls the majority of information from the UW PWS into Drupal
using content types as storage.

Created by the University of Washington Information School; see LICENSE file.


Install
==========================
Move folder to DRUPAL_ROOT/sites/all/modules and rename to "uwpeople".  Enable
the module in Drupal.  NOTE: LTS, the UW Groups LTS plugin, and the UW People
LTS plugin will have to be setup before this module will work.
